  <!-- <h2>How To Make Napalm (And Get on a Government Watchlist)</h2>
  <p>Making napalm is simple and not dangerous at all&trade;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First, you need 3 things: a cup that you dont mind burning and won't dissolve in gasoline, some gasoline, and styrofoam 
      (the hard kind works <i>wonderfully</i>).</li>
    <li>Pour some gasoline into the cup (only a bit, you can make a <i>lot</i> of napalm with a little bit of gasoline. </li>
    <li>Break a lot of styrofoam into chunks and throw it into the cup. Stir (or just wait). </li>
    <li>If theres any more styrofoam left, put a <i>little</i> bit more gasoline in. </li>
    <li>If it looks like cum, thats normal.</li>
    <li><strong>burn it</strong> &#128520;</li>

  <h2>How I (Never) Got Good at Mindustry</h2>
  <p>So I discovered Minustry messing around in Google Play Store on my school Chromebook (See below: How I (Kinda) Became My Schools 
    Chromebook Gaming God) and immediately got hooked by its kinda simplistic graphics. The lack of a tutorial for my kinda 
    small brain made me eventually quit (or maybe because the mobile version is inferior). Later, I discovered that 
    Mindustry had a PC app, and it was way better than the mobile app. Still though, the lack of a tutorial drove me away. </p>
  <p>Now fast forward to like thursday and I was at a friends house. We were both bored, so I suggested Mindustry. 
    Due to having a much bigger brain than before, I picked it up <i>easily</i> and decided it was kinda fun. So then I downloaded
     it on my computer and got gud... kinda. You see, I'm kinda shit at videogames. Also Frozen Forest is way too fucking hard.</p>
  
  <h2>How I (Kinda) Became My Schools Chromebook Gaming God</h2>
  <p>In 5th grade, the miraculous discovery was made (by yours truly) that Chromebook can easily be manipulated. Go to the settings, 
    then go to the android settings. From there, you can add another account, and download games from that account in the Play Store.</p>
  <p>There was a strong risk of heading to the principals office (the horror!), so naturally I told e v e r y o n e. </p>
  <p>I quickly realized what I had created, and I could have had a monopoly on Chromebook gaming, except, in my haste to be at the top, 
    I had pushed myself to the bottom. People <i>much</i> more talented than me quickly began exploiting this, installing alternate OS's 
    and shit. I needed to find something I was good at, somewhere I could shine. And then I thought of it. Chromebook gaming. Let me 
    explain. </p>
  <p>It started the day after I discovered this. I was playing Fruit Ninja on the bus, when a couple friends leaned over and started 
    watching. They asked me where I was playing it, maybe one of those Unblocked Google sites? I nodded noncommitically, entirely 
    focused on not slicing that <i>one. freaking. bomb</i>. Later, after we got to school, I realized I could "profit" off of this. 
    Profit is marked in apostrophes because I wasn't really earning money, just clout. Then again, clout in a social place could be 
    even more valuable than money. Also, it made me friends (I moved to a new school that year), so I guess I'm not complaining. </p>
  <p>I ran my semilegal gaming ring for over a year, until some bitches got caught in the first half of 6th grade. During my 1 year 
    gaming spree, I played some classics, like Candy Crush and Angry Birds. I also played some not-so-classics, like "Mobile Legends 
    Bang Bang", a slightly shitty League of Legends clone. I also played *deep breath in*: Clash of Clans, Kick the Buddy, Granny, 
    Bitlife, Cut the Rope, CoD Mobile, PUBG Mobile, some crappy Minecraft clones, Mindustry, and others.</p> -->
